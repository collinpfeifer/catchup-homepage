## March 2021 Update

![sunflowers](./images/march.jpg)

I am happy to announce that I am looking for a full time web development position! I would love anything front-end or MERN full-stack development. I would consider React as one of my most used libraries and what I am most specialized using, but am very much willing to learn anything new! I am willing to relocate or go remote. Feel free to reach out through the home page of this site!
