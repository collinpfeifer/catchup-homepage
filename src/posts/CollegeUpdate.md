## Indiana University Update

![lake](./images/college.jpeg)

I wanted to give a life update and explain that I am currently attending Indiana University to pursue a major in Psychology and Computer Science. I have been settling in well, adjusting to the new and everchanging lifestyle, and being able to pursue my passions along with that. I have already tested out of the introductory computer science course, but am planning to continue by taking relevant coursework next semester. I am so excited to continue with my education and be a Hoosier!
