## Modern React Redux Course

![bee](./images/react.jpg)

I just finished the react redux complete course by Stephen Grider and It is 10/10! It was an amazing experience all around and such a well thought out course.

Stephen is one of the best teachers I have ever heard from and I will continue to look out for more of his work. He perfectly was able to explain some of the industry's best practices such as React hooks and Redux and made it effortless to code along with him. The projects were intuitive and were able to keep my attention for hours. He helped me be able to think through the building blocks of react and components and how the ecosystem fits together.
