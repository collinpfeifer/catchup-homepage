## Advanced Intelligence Services Inc. Update

![red car](./images/aisupdate.jpg)

I have been working at Advanced Intelligence Services Inc. as a web development intern for about 3 months now and it has allowed me to grow throughout my interpersonal skills along with my development skills. I have been able to grow through my use of Node, Express and Material UI to better grow my full stack development skills.

Working with the interns is easier than I thought and not at all awkward, Iâ€™ve been able to code, ask questions and feel like I am valued. Hopefully more good news to follow in the future.
