## Complete Node Developer Course

![desert](./images/node.jpg)

I just finished the complete Node.js developer course by Andrew Mead and It is again one of the best courses I have taken! It was a challenging time deciding which Node course to choose, but after going through Andrewâ€™s I know I chose the right one.

Every lesson fit together and flowed seamlessly, leaving minimal questions to be asked. Andrew explored the biggest modern server-side development stack and explained every part perfectly. The projects were extremely helpful, and the challenges helped me remember vital details to the infrastructure of my future servers. He helped me see how data flows throughout both sides of an application and how the data interacts and changes. I am now able to take what I learned and go out and build my own full stack projects.
