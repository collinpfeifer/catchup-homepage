## IU Center for Applied Cybersecurity Internship

During my time at IU, I have begun my college career by working for the IU Center for Applied Cybersecurity as a Software Engineer Intern. I have been working with my supervisor Ryan Kiser and fellow intern Chanakya Kenguva.

This project is expected to take around 8 months and is meant to allow the CACR's clients to be able to access their data securely and view their data in a pleasing manner, allowing for comparison with previous months and for secure and quick data visualization.
